# PoUW - Proof of Useful Work 

This project explores replacing hash-based POW with competitive optimization tasks.

Validators compete to improve a shared optimization objective. Each accepted block represents a verifiable improvement to the global solution.

## Scope and Intent

This is a research-oriented personal project focused on protocol design and experimentation.

This project is **not**:
- a production-level system
- a blockchain
- a cryptocurrency

The goal is to explore consensus-like mechanisms based on useful computation in a controlled, simplified setting, without economic, cryptographic, or deployment concerns.

## Status
Early research and prototyping.

## Research Notes
Design decisions, assumptions, and experimental results are documented in /docs.
