# PoUW - Proof of Useful Work 

This project explores replacing hash-based POW with competitive optimization tasks.

Validators compete to improve a shared optimization objective. Each accepted block represents a verifiable improvement to the global solution.

This is a research-oriented personal project focused on protocol design and experimentation, not a production system.

## Status
Early research and prototyping.

## Research Notes
Design decisions, assumptions, and experimental results are documented in /docs.
